[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I found a love
For me
Oh darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl
Beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone
Waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man
Stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams
I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love
To carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children
Of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
While listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel
In person
And she looks perfect
And he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

Alright
Ooh, yeah

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

Letra de ""Guerrera"" ft. Dellafuente[Estribillo: C. Tangana]
Ella, que ha nacido modelo, diva y superestrella
Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
(Es una guerrera)

[Verso 1: Dellafuente]
Ella tiene arsenal, ella, pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le gusta viajar, ella, pega'ita a mi vera
Tiene el pedal, ella, cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

Lo juro, me muera
Es una guerrera
Lo juro, me muera
Lo juro, me muera

[Verso 2: Dellafuente & C. Tangana]
Ella roba en las tiendas
Atraca los bancos, se entera de to' los santos
Se sabe el nombre del jurado
Tiene fichados los horarios
Tiene una hacienda, tres o cuatro barcos
Un M4 y un Lambo
Tiene cuero y piel en el armario
Un nombre hecho por todo el barrio
Y ella cierra los ojos y ve
A través de las paredes
Tiene la fuerza de mil hombres
Y yo me pierdo en su timidez
Eso...

[Estribillo: C. Tangana & Dellafuente]
Ella, que ha nacido modelo, diva y superestrella
Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Eso es

[Verso 3: Dellafuente]
Y el orgullo me robó
A punta de Kalashnikov
Y mi cerebro secuestró
Calla'ita con silenciador
Y ahora to'l mundo sabe:
Que tiene arsenal pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le encanta viajar pega'íta a mi vera
Ella, tiene el pedal, y cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

Ella, lo juro, me muera
Ella, es una guerrera

Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
(Es una guerrera)

[Verso 1: Dellafuente]
Ella tiene arsenal, ella, pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le gusta viajar, ella, pega'ita a mi vera
Tiene el pedal, ella, cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

Lo juro, me muera
Es una guerrera
Lo juro, me muera
Lo juro, me muera

[Verso 2: Dellafuente & C. Tangana]
Ella roba en las tiendas
Atraca los bancos, se entera de to' los santos
Se sabe el nombre del jurado
Tiene fichados los horarios
Tiene una hacienda, tres o cuatro barcos
Un M4 y un Lambo
Tiene cuero y piel en el armario
Un nombre hecho por todo el barrio
Y ella cierra los ojos y ve
A través de las paredes
Tiene la fuerza de mil hombres
Y yo me pierdo en su timidez
Eso...

[Estribillo: C. Tangana & Dellafuente]
Ella, que ha nacido modelo, diva y superestrella
Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Eso es

[Verso 3: Dellafuente]
Y el orgullo me robó
A punta de Kalashnikov
Y mi cerebro secuestró
Calla'ita con silenciador
Y ahora to'l mundo sabe:
Que tiene arsenal pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le encanta viajar pega'íta a mi vera
Ella, tiene el pedal, y cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

[Outro: C. Tangana & Dellafuente]
Ella, lo juro, me muera
Ella, es una guerrera
Lo juro, me muera
Ella, lo juro, me muera...

Letra de ""El Patio""[Coro]
Fuera, vete de mi casa
Tú no eres mi amiga
Que yo sigo jugando qué más da
Sigo jugando solo, me aburro

El patio está vació
Y suenan las sirenas
Y yo sigo jugando, qué más da
Sigo jugando y siempre me castigas

[Estribillo]
Y solo quiero que te vayas
Solo quiero que se acabe
Solo quiero que me dejes solo

[verso]
Fuera, vete de mi casa
Suéltame las manos
No soy más que un niño
Con los pies descalzos

Y yo sigo jugando, qué más da
Sigo jugando solo

Nada, ya no queda nada
Solo tu delirio
Tu ruido insoportable en el salón
No queda nada más que tu fantasma

[Estribillo]
Y solo quiero que te vayas
Solo quiero que se acabe
Solo quiero que me dejes solo

[Coro]
Fuera, vete de mi casa
Suéltame las manos
No soy más que un niño
Con los pies descalzos

Y yo sigo jugando, qué más da
Sigo jugando solo
Yo sigo jugando, qué más da

[Verso 1]
No hay reglas para amar
No hay forma de acertar
Solo pretendo ser
Tu mejor verdad

Pero tú vienes y te vas
Y yo alerto al corazón
Si te vas a quedar
No entenderé otro adiós

[Pre-Coro]
Que el hambre que tienes se olvida
De las mordidas que ya le dio a mi vida

[Coro]
No vaya a ser que te quiera y te vuelvas a ir
No vaya a ser que me enamore aún más de ti
No vaya a ser que me equivoque y te vuelva a perder
No vaya a ser que me caiga otra vez

[Verso 2]
Te juro que intenté
No verte en otra piel
Vacío en el papel
Mi rabia y mi ser

Espero no llevar
La cruz de perdonar
A quién no me hace bien
Y juega a marear

[Pre-Coro]
El tiempo no borra, ni esconde tanta despedida
No busques más salida

[Coro]
No vaya a ser que te quiera y te vuelvas a ir
No vaya a ser que me enamore aún más de ti
No vaya a ser que me equivoque y te vuelva a perder
No vaya a ser que me caiga otra vez

No vaya a ser que te quiera y te vuelvas a ir
No vaya a ser que me enamore aún más de ti
No vaya a ser que me equivoque y te vuelva a perder
No vaya a ser que me caiga otra vez

[Verso 1]
Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo
Caigo de nuevo en tu red
Sé que tarda un tiempo
Curarme de ti de una vez

Tuve tantos momentos felices
Que olvido lo triste que fue
Darte de mi alma
Lo que tú echaste a perder

[Pre-Coro]
Yo no quería amarte
Tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé
Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer

[Coro]
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos
En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor
Y en la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz
Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor

[Verso 2]
Tienes, la misma culpa que tengo
Aunque te cueste admitir
Que sientes como siento
La almohada no suele mentir

[Pre-Coro]
Y yo no quería amarte
Tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé
Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer

[Coro]
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos
En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor
En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz
Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, ""Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.""
""I'm gonna give you all of my love.""
""Nobody matters like you.""
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, ""Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life."" (Straight!)
""You're gonna grow and have a good life.""
""I'm gonna do what I've got to do.""

Single mum, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah!)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come, you're well prepared (Oh, no!)
And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah!)
Mh, Marie, the paps' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily your workflow, heavily you know
So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

When she says, ""Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.""
""I'm gonna give you all of my love.""
""Nobody matters like you.""

Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo

Angels surround you, just dry your eye

Burning like embers, falling tender
Longing for the days of no surrender

[Verse 1]
Hoy me pregunto que será de ti 
Te tuve cerca y ahora estás tan lejos 
Pero prohibirme recordar lo nuestro es imposible 
Es imposible

No me perdono se que te perdí 
Pero expiraron los remordimientos 
Fui dictador y el no dejarte ir debió haber sido mi primer decreto 

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuatro años sin mirarte 
Tres postales y un bolero 
Dos meses y me olvidaste 
Ni siquiera me pensaste un 29 de febrero 

Andan diciendo por la calle 
Que solo le eres fiel al viento 
El mismo que nunca hizo falta 
Para levantar tu falda cada día de por medio

[Chorus]
Cómo te atreves a volver 
A darle vida a lo que estaba muerto 
La soledad me había tratado bien 
Y no eres quien para exigir derechos 

Cómo te atreves a volver 
Y a tus cenizas convertir en fuego 
Hoy mis mentiras veo caer 
Que no es verdad que te olvidé 
Cómo te atreves a volver 

Ohhh
Ohhh

[Verse 2]
Por qué volviste si te vas a ir
Tantas mentiras que al final no veo 
Nunca fui bueno para distinguir, al fin y al cabo siempre me las creo

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuatro vidas me juraste 
Tres te odio y un te quiero 
Dos consejos para darte 
Prefiero ser un cobarde que olvidarte de primero 

Andan diciendo por la calle 
Que solo le eres fiel al viento 
El mismo que nunca hizo falta 
Para levantar tu falda cada día de por medio 

[Chorus]
Cómo te atreves a volver 
A darle vida a lo que estaba muerto 
La soledad me había tratado bien 
Y no eres quien para exigir derechos 

Cómo te atreves a volver 
Y a tus cenizas convertir en fuego 
Hoy mis mentiras veo caer 
Que no es verdad que te olvidé 
Cómo te atreves a volver 

Ohhh
Ohhh

[Bridge]
Cómo te atreves a volver
Me hiciste daño pero sigo vivo 
Contigo yo me acostumbré a perder 
Mi corazón funciona sin latidos 

[Chorus]
Cómo te atreves a volver 
Y a tus cenizas convertir en fuego 
Hoy mis mentiras veo caer 
Que no es verdad que te olvidé 
Cómo te atreves a volver 

Ohhh (Cómo te atreves a volver)

Me perderé
Me perderé en el torbellino del amor

Me subiré
Me subiré en un remolino de color

Confundiré
Confundiré lo que es el norte con el sur
Renegaré de ese pasado donde tú
Tú dijiste adiós

Escaparé
Escaparé como Dorita rumbo a Oz

Descubriré
Descubriré que el mago es solo una ilusión

Escogeré
Escogeré entre las tinieblas y la luz
Y lloraré con un presente donde tú
Tú eres ficción

Que hará temblar mi miedo

Monumental revuelo
Que revolverá lo malo con lo bueno

Un festival de fuego
Y retumbará
Sacudirá hasta el cielo
Espectacular

Me montaré
Me montaré en un arco iris de neón

Y viajaré
Y viajaré a Las Vegas, Marte o Benidorm

Y tomaré
Y tomaré la decisión a cara o cruz
Apostaré por un futuro donde tú
Tú eres ficción
